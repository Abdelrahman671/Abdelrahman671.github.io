## Step 1:  

After downloading the zip file and extracting it. we will find an image jpg file.

By passing the image file to strings command `strings squirrel.jpg | less`, we will observe a link to download another file.

## Step 2:

After downloading the zip file, we will find that it is protected by a password.

So let's use `zip2john tool` and see if we are able to crack the password or not.

Getting hash of zip file :

![get hash of zip file using zip2john](/assets/img/squirrel/w4.png)

Running rockyou.txt wordlist to crack the password hash

Since I have cracked this hash before so let's use the `--show` option to display the password.

Zip file password : `squirrel07`


## Step 3:

Passing `EVIL file` to `file command`, we will observe that it can't recognize the type of it's data.

So I decided to check the hexdump of this file in order to check the magic bytes of it.

using this command : `xxd -g 1 EVIL | less`

We will find that the first 4 bytes are corrupted according to the JFIF file signature.

Modifying these bytes by any hexeditor tool, I have used `ghex` then changed the file extension to `EVIL.jfif`.

## Step 4:

Opening the image file after we have modified the corrupted bytes and changed its extension, we will see a text in top-right corner.

![jfif image](/assets/img/squirrel/w9.png)

Copying this text and using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/), It will detect that it is a base32 encoding text.

Decoding the text from base32 and we will find the flag : `flag{Ev1l_S9uirr3lz}`
